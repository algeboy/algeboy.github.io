## Call me James
### Theorem 1.* Nilpotent $\Leftrightarrow$ Tensors $\Leftrightarrow$ Data science

<!-- <p class="uk-text-large" align="left"> -->
<i>Proof:</i>  A <strong>Nilpotent</strong>---zero powered $0=x^n=x\cdot x\cdots x$ hides a product $(\cdot)$.  And every zero $(0)$ needs a plus $(+)$.  For times to talk to plus means to <strong>distribute</strong>  
<center> $$a\cdot (b+c)=a\cdot b+a\cdot c.$$  </center>
Distributive products factor through tensor products. That's just posh speak for <strong>multiplication table</strong> What's the difference between a <strong>Multiplication table</strong> and a <strong>data table</strong>? None really. $\Box$
