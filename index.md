## Call me James
### Theorem 1.*  All the following are equivalent:
### <center>Nilpotent $\Leftrightarrow$ Tensors $\Leftrightarrow$ Data science</center>

<!-- <p class="uk-text-large" align="left"> -->
<i>Proof:</i>  <strong>Nilpotent</strong>---zero powered, well to have $0=x^n=x\cdot x\cdots x$ requires a product $(\cdot)$.
But every zero $(0)$ needs a plus $(+)$. 
For times to talk to plus means to <strong>distribute</strong>
$$a\cdot (b+c)=a\cdot b+a\cdot c.$$  
Distributive products factor through tensor products.
That's just posh speak for <strong>multiplication 
table</strong>
What's the difference between a 
<strong>Multiplication table</strong> and a <strong>data table</strong>?
None really.
