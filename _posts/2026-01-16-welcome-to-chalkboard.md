Welcome to my chalkboard posts! This is a space where I'll share short articles, mathematical insights, and thoughts from the classroom.

## What You'll Find Here

I'll be writing about:

- **Mathematical discoveries** from my research
- **Teaching insights** from the classroom
- **Linear algebra applications** in modern computing
- **Tensor algebra concepts** and their practical uses

## The Format

These posts are designed to be:
- **Concise** - Getting straight to the point
- **Accessible** - Written for both students and colleagues  
- **Practical** - Connecting theory to real applications

Think of this as a digital extension of the classroom chalkboard - a place for working through ideas, sharing discoveries, and connecting mathematical concepts to the world around us.

## Navigation

You can move between posts using the navigation at the bottom of each article, or return to the main posts page to see everything at once.

Looking forward to sharing more mathematical adventures with you!
