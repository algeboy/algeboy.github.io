> If the backbone of data science is linear algebra, then shouldn't the What does a mathematician know about linear algebra that would actually help a data scientist?

That is the starting point of Linear Data, our new textbook that blends equal parts linear algebra, data science, and storytelling.
At its heart is a simple conviction: students shouldn’t learn linear algebra first and then wonder where the data is. Instead, they should encounter vectors, matrices, and tensors as data from the very beginning—images, audio, networks, spreadsheets, and signals—objects they already interact with every day.

## Why “Linear Data” instead of “Linear Algebra”?
We renamed the subject because we reshaped the perspective.
Traditional linear algebra begins with formal vector spaces and eventually (sometimes) shows where they’re useful. Our approach reverses that flow:

Start with real data—bus schedules, RGB pixels, sound clips, video game sales, spectrograms, social networks.
Use linear operations to create information: rescaling, blending, filtering, feature extraction, projections.
Build the mathematical structure only once the student needs it.

Rather than treating linear algebra as an abstract edifice, we treat it as the operating system for modern data.

Meet Lineum: Our Frustrated, Curious, Very Relatable Guide
To help students voice their real questions—What is this math even for? Is this useful? Can’t we just skip to the point?—we created Lineum, a small wizard with large opinions.
Lineum appears throughout the book in comic‑style panels, arguing with clocks, mixing fruit salad, missing buses, combining audio clips, and accidentally inventing impossible recipes. Through Lineum’s mishaps, we expose the hidden assumptions behind data work:

Why not every vector operation makes sense on every dataset
Why the “average” phone number tells you nothing
Why some linear combinations describe reality—and others describe magic

The storytelling is not decoration: it reinforces the central theme that linear methods are powerful only when paired with good questions and good interpretation.

What’s New (and Unusual) About This Book
1. Linear algebra taught as data science from day one
Students learn vectors as bus‑arrival times, RGB colors, audio samples, and rows of data frames—not as arrow diagrams in zero‑context.
2. Equal emphasis on computation and meaning
We use notebooks, pseudocode, and real datasets, but we always ask:
Is this linear operation informative for the problem at hand?
This leads to our guiding tool, the IVORY heuristic, for determining when linear methods make sense.

3. A unified story linking signals, images, networks, and tensors
Spectrograms, convolutions, graph Laplacians, PCA, and neural networks all arise naturally—not as “bonus chapters”, but as extensions of the same linear ideas.
4. Comics + narrative to lower affective barriers
Students often feel apprehensive about abstraction. Lineum’s impatience and curiosity “give permission” to ask the obvious questions.
5. Mathematical honesty paired with practical flexibility
We maintain rigorous definitions (vector spaces, linear maps, kernels, eigenvalues), but always motivated by real data:
audio blending, noise cancellation, color channels, feature vectors, and interpretable transformations.

Why This Matters
Data science relies on linear thinking everywhere: filtering signals, projecting data, compressing images, classifying categories, modeling networks, and training neural networks. But too often these tools are taught as black‑box software patterns or as abstract mathematics divorced from data.
Linear Data makes the connection explicit:
linear algebra is data science, when taught as linear data.
And along the way, students learn something deeper:
mathematics becomes far more meaningful when it is anchored in story—whether the story of a dataset, a scientific question, or a small wizard trying very hard to catch a bus.
